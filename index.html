  <h1>CHSH</h1>
  <p>
  CHSH is a collaborative game for two players. We'll call them Alice and Bob.

    <ul>
        <li>Each player flips a coin.
        <li>Each player then chooses to output one of two symbols.<br>We'll use &#x25B2; and &#x25CF;, but they could be any two symbols.
    </ul>

  </p>

    <p>
    A judge looks at Alice and Bob's output, and decides whether they collectively <b>win</b> or <b>lose</b> according to the following rules:

    <ul>
        <li>If either Alice or Bob flip heads (<b>HH</b> or <b>HT</b> or <b>TH</b>),<br/> they should output the same symbol.  So, &#x25B2;  &#x25B2;  and  &#x25CF; &#x25CF; are winning moves.
        <li>If Alice and Bob both flip tails (<b>TT</b>), <br/>they should output different symbols. So, &#x25B2;  &#x25CF;  and &#x25CF; &#x25B2; are winning moves.
    </ul>
   The aim of the game is for Alice and Bob to collaborate, so as to win as often as possible. We can summarize these rules with an occult symbol:

    <p>
    Alice and Bob are playing a perfect game. Since their coins are not hidden, they can easily negotiate a strategy such that they win 100% of the time. 
    The game is too easy.  Boring.
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's make things more interesting and put Alice and Bob back-to-back. 
    Now Alice can't see Bob's coin, and vice-versa. 
    We'll let them meet up and agree on a strategy before each coin flip, 
    but they are forbidden from communicating after the coins have flipped.
    <ul>
        <li>What is the best strategy?</li>
        <li>How often can they win, on average? </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    Alice and Bob are using a really simple strategy. They're just saying "&#x25CF;" every time. As a result, they're average score is exactly 75%. 
    Is there a more complicated strategy which does better?  Nope &mdash; so long as Alice and Bob cannot communicate after the coin flip, 75% is provably the maximum possible success probability.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
    So, Alice and Bob meet up before each round. 
    They can exchange any information they like at this point, but it doesn't seem to help beat 75%.
    What if they share quantum resources?
